django-upgrade documentation
============================

*Automatically upgrade your Django project code.*

----

**Improve your code quality** with my book `Boost Your Django DX <https://adamchainz.gumroad.com/l/byddx>`__ which covers using  pre-commit, django-upgrade, and many other tools.
I (Adam Johnson) wrote django-upgrade whilst working on the book!

----

django-upgrade is a tool that automatically upgrades your Django project code.
It changes code to avoid deprecation warnings and migrates some patterns to newer Django idioms.
Use it to ease upgrading Django and ensure your code uses the latest features.

To get started, see :doc:`installation` and :doc:`usage`.
